About
This is a Rust crate for parsing a "Standard MIDI file format"-file.
I wrote this as an experiment trying to learn Rust.

Usage
See the examples dir, but basically it is:

...
extern crate midifile;
use midifile::smf;
...
let mut reader = BufReader::new(&file);
let midi_file = smf::read_file(&mut reader);
...
